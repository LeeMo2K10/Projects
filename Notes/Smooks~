Smooks:
-------

         Smooks is an extensible framework for building applications for processing XML and non XML  data (CSV, EDI, Java etc) using Java.

         While Smooks can be used as a lightweight platform on which to build your own custom processing logic for a wide range of data formats, "out of the box" it comes with some very useful features that can be used individually, or seamlessly combined together:

Java Binding:
--------------
        Populate a Java Object Model from a data source (CSV, EDI, XML, Java etc). Populated object models can be used as a transformation result itself, or can be used by (e.g.) Templating resources for generating XML or other character based results. Also supports Virtual Object Models (Maps and Lists of typed data), which can be used by EL and Templating functionality.

Transformation:
-----------------
         Perform a wide range of Data Transforms - XML to XML, CSV to XML, EDI to XML, XML to EDI, XML to CSV, Java to XML, Java to EDI, Java to CSV, Java to Java, XML to Java, EDI to Java etc.

Huge Message Processing :
-------------------------
        Process huge messages (GBs) - Split, Transform and Route message fragments to JMS, File, Database etc destinations.

Message Enrichment :
--------------------
                Enrich a message with data from a Database, or other Datasources.

Complex Message Validation:  Rules based fragment validation.
--------------------------- 
ORM Based Message Persistence:
------------------------------
*. Use an entity persistence framework (like Ibatis, Hibernate or any JPA compatible framework) to access a database and use it's query    language or CRUD methods to read from it or write to it.

*. Use custom Data Access Objects (DAO's) to access a database and use it's CRUD methods to read from it or write to it.

Combine:
--------
        Perform Extract Transform Load (ETL) operations by leveraging Smooks' Transformation, Routing and Persistence functionality.

Nimbus Service on Master Node - 
--------------------------------
1. Nimbus is a daemon that runs on the master node of Storm cluster. 
2. It is responsible for distributing the code among the worker nodes, assigning input data sets to machines for processing and monitoring for failures.
3. Nimbus service is an Apache Thrift service enabling you to submit the code in any programming language. 
4. Nimbus service relies(depend) on Apache ZooKeeper service to monitor the message processing tasks as all the worker nodes update their tasks status in Apache ZooKeeper service.

Supervisor Service on Worker Node -
------------------------------------

1. All the workers nodes in Storm cluster run a daemon called Supervisor. 
2. Supervisor service receives the work assigned to a machine by Nimbus service.
3. Supervisor manages worker processes to complete the tasks assigned by Nimbus. 

Topology - 
----------
1. Topology, in simple terms, is a graph of computation. 
2. Each node in a topology contains processing logic, and links between nodes indicate how data should be passed around between nodes.
3. A Topology typically runs distributively on multiple workers processes on multiple worker nodes.

Spout -
--------
1. A Topology starts with a spout(source of streams). 
2. A stream is made of unbounded sequence of tuples.
3. Tuples are sequences, just like lists,The tuples cannot be changed unlike lists. 
4. A spout may read tuples off a messaging framework and emit(produce) them as stream of messages or it may connect to twitter 
   API and emit a stream of tweets.

Bolt - 
-------
1. A Bolt represents a node in a topology.
2. It defines smallest processing logic within a topology. Output of a bolt can be fed into another bolt as input in a topology.
